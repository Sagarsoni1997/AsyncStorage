# AsyncStorage
Login and Logout using Async-Storage where i get input from user and if he is Authorised user then it will redirect to Home Page (home.js) otherwise show invalid username or password and stay on login page. 

I also add logout functionality on it for logout and if user Logged in and close the App and reopen the App he exist on Home page because we saved it in AysncStorage (Local Device storage)..
